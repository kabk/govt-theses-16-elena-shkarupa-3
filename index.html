Abstract

In my thesis I am introducing the notion of  ‘a hypertext’ as a ‘metagenre’
of modern time, where ‘hypertext’ is verbal and non-verbal information organized according to the principle
of ‘rhizome’: a structure, where all the elements are autonomous, however possess a reference to each other, 
allowing to create one’s own connections between them and therefore personal interpretation.
(Jan Jaques Rousseau, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Pierre-Félix Guattari, Theodor H. Nelson).
And a ‘metagenre’ here is a way of method functioning in the culture, when the experience is absorbed not
through a strict quantity-quality canoon, not through sharply defined signs of a composition, but through
a conceptual position. It reflects culture and spirit of time.

Metagenre is always interdisciplinary and in this case it is formed under the influence of the paradigm shift
(Marchall Macluhan, E.J.Burlina), caused by the development of technology, merging types of media into one, where each of
the components is relatively autonomous, but is integral part of the whole. Extracting such a component will not destroy the system,
however will make a component meaningless.

I focus on the interdisciplinary combination of language, literature and graphic design 
(Voynich Manuscript, Codex Seraphinianus, Rohonci-kódex , works of Jim Sanborn and Neo Rauch).
I believe that researching the method of the metagenre with the named interdisciplinary combination, 
shreds light on creating an intrigue, mystification and a fictional world in art and in graphic design.
