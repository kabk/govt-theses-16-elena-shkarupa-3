Abstract

In my thesis I am introducing the notion of ‘a hypertext’ as a ‘metagenre’ of modern time,
where ‘hypertext’ is verbal and non-verbal information organized according to the principle 
of ‘rhizome’: a structure, where all elements are autonomous, but reference each other,
allowing one to create one’s own connections between them and therefore construct an individual 
interpretation.(Jan Jaques Rousseau, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Pierre-Félix Guattari, Theodor H. Nelson). 
A ‘metagenre’ refers to a method of interacting with culture, when an experience is neither
absorbed  through a strict quantity-quality canoon, nor through sharply defined signs of a composition,
but through a conceptual position. It reflects the culture and the spirit of the times. 
Metagenre is always interdisciplinary and in this case it is formed under the influence of the paradigm shift 
(Marchall Macluhan, E.J.Burlina),caused by the  rapid development of technology in the 20th century,
merging various types of media into one,where each of the components is relatively autonomous, 
but is an integral part of the whole. Extracting one component will not destroy the system,
but will make the component meaningless.In this paper I will examine the interdisciplinary combination
of language, literature and graphic design as an example of the matagenre(Voynich Manuscript,
Codex Seraphinianus, works of Jim Sanborn and Neo Rauch etc.)
I believe researching the metagenre will help to bridge the devision between multiple media and will advance the 
interpretation of  multimedia artworks.

The inability to analyse interdisciplinary work holistically, rather than just its separate 
components is dictated by the limitations of separate disciplines. This means that there is a demand
for a new type of analysis. Interdisciplinary artworks should be analysed from a conceptual point of view, 
which is flexible and subject to personal interpretation, because of the new level to which
a recepient is involved in the creative process.
